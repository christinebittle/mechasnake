This project was a lot of fun. With a limited amount of time I decided to go with a classic -- Snake. I heard that the theme was "repair", so I applied a little twist. The snake must go around collecting different mechanical goodies in order to fix himself and get longer.

The assets were created by me as 32x32 pixel sprites. I chose Canvas to represent the gameboard. This is something that I somewhat regret because the game snake has a more discreet sense of pixels and positions -- leading to many little errors!

Ultimately, I had a lot of fun figuring out little pieces of logic and working together alongside others to build a fun game!
